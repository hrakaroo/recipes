## Ingredients

- [ ] 20 ounces Italian tipo "00" flour (see notes), plus extra for dusting dough
- [ ] 0.3 ounces kosher salt, plus extra for assembly
- [ ] 0.2 ounces instant yeast, such as SAF Instant Yeast
- [ ] 0.2 ounces sugar
- [ ] 12 ounces water
- [ ] 1 (14-ounce) can whole peeled Italian tomatoes
- [ ] 12 ounces buffalo mozzarella or fresh cow's milk mozzarella
- [ ] 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- [ ] 24 basils

## Steps

### Make Dough

Combine flour, salt, yeast, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer
fitted with a dough hook attachment. Whisk to combine. Add water and
knead on low speed until mixture just comes together and no dry flour
remains. Rest for 10 minutes.

Knead on low speed for an additional 10 minutes. The mixture should
come together into a cohesive mass that barely sticks to the bottom of
the bowl as it kneads. Depending on the type of flour used, you may
need to add up to 1/2 cup additional flour. If dough sticks heavily to
bottom of bowl, add flour 1 tablespoon at a time with mixer running
until it forms a mass that just barely sticks to the bowl. Cover bowl
tightly with plastic or transfer the dough to 2 gallon-sized zipper
lock bags, seal, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to 72
hours.

### Raise

Transfer dough to a floured work surface and dust top with additional
flour. Using a bench scraper, divide dough into 6 even pieces,
approximately 6 ounces each. Using floured hands, shape each piece
into a neat ball by gathering dough towards the bottom. Coat 6 small
containers with nonstick cooking spray or olive oil (large cereal
bowls work great for this) and add 1 dough ball to each bowl. Lightly
spray top of dough ball with nonstick cooking spray. Cover tightly
with plastic wrap, and allow to rise at room temperature for 2 hours
(dough should roughly double in volume).

### Toppings

Meanwhile, drain tomatoes in a fine-mesh strainer and break up with
your fingers, squeezing excess juice out from the interior. Transfer
tomatoes to a blender with 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and blend until
smooth. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Cut mozzarella into 1/2-inch
chunks and place on a plate on a triple layer of paper towels or a
clean kitchen towel. Place another triple layer of paper towels or
clean dish towel on top of the cheese and stack another plate on
top. Allow the excess water to drain out for at least 10 minutes.

### Prepare

Transfer 1 ball of dough to a medium bowl filled with flour and flip
to coat. Lift it and gently pat off excess flour. Transfer to a
floured surface and gently stretch into a 10-inch circle, leaving the
outer 1-inch edge slightly thicker than the center.

The best way to do this is to start by gently stretching with your
fingertips. Pick up the slightly stretched dough and place it on the
opened face of your left hand. Toss it back and forth between your
opened hands, rotating it slightly with each toss until it stretches
out to around 8-inches in diameter. Return it to the work
surface. With your left hand flat in the center of the round, use your
right hand to stretch the edge of the dough out, rotating as needed
until it is an even 10-inches in diameter.

### Cook

Have your tomato sauce, drained cheese, pizza dough, olive oil, kosher
salt, and basil leaves ready and close to the stovetop. Preheat
broiler to high and arrange rack so you can just barely fit a 12-inch
heavy-bottomed oven-proof cast iron or stainless steel skillet on top
of it. Dust skillet with flour, tap out excess, then heat skillet over
high heat until lightly smoking, about 3 minutes.

Transfer 1 dough round to the skillet. It should fill up the entire
bottom surface. Working quickly, spread 2 tablespoons sauce evenly
over dough, leaving the outer 1-inch border un-sauced. Top with 1/6 of
the cheese chunks. Season with kosher salt. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon
olive oil, and scatter 4 basil leaves over the surface.

Transfer skillet to broiler and broil until pizza is puffed and
charred in spots (this can take anywhere between 1 1/2 to 4 minutes,
depending on the strength of your broiler). Return skillet to stovetop
and cook until bottom is charred in spots, using a thin metal spatula
to peek after about 1 minute (depending on the skillet you use, you
may skip this step if pizza is already charred). Transfer the pizza to
a cutting board and serve immediately. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to bake
remaining pizzas.
