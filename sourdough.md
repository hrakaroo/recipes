# Sourdough Bread

I'm going with a 75% hydration recipe as the 80% is really hard to
work with.

## Night before

I take my starter out of the fridge and pour 75g of it into a new jar
and add 75g of fresh flour and 75g of water.  Mix that up and let it
sit on the counter until the next day.

## Day 1

Mix together
400g white flour
100g whole wheat flour 
375g of water

Let that sit for 45 minutes to autolysis.

add 75g of my starter and 10g of salt.  Mix well and let it sit for 30 mins

after 30 mins stretch and fold dough 4 times, let sit for another 30 mins
after 30 mins stretch and fold dough 4 times, let sit for another 30 mins
after 30 mins stretch and fold dough 4 times, let sit for another 30 mins
after 30 mins stretch and fold dough 4 times

let it sit for three hours.

after three hours I do one more stretch and fold 4 times and transfer
the dough to a floured proofing bowl.  Cover with a shower cap and put
it in the fridge for 14 hours.

## Day 2

Preheat the dutch oven in the oven at 500 degrees for 45 minutes.

after 45 minutes transfer the dough to parchment paper.  use a razor
blade to score the top and drop it into the dutch oven.

add some ice cubes to the dutch oven just before closing the lid and
putting it in the oven

bake for 30 minutes with the lid on.  

after 30 mins take the lid off and bake for another 20 mins, but
careful to not let it burn too much.
